Supplicant View
===================

![Draft logo](/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/icon.png)

Hi there, this is my very first attempt to make an app for Android, it serves to view and copy the password for the wifi connections that are saved in your phone. I was tired of my friends that ask me for passwords that I not remember.

It's very simple, and needs root permissions.

I hope view the app shortly in Google Play, anyway, the apk will be available soon in this repo.
